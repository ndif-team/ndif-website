<p>
The National Deep Inference Fabric (NDIF) is supported by a generous grant
from the U.S. National Science Foundation. It is developed by a team at Northeastern
University in Boston, Massachusetts, building upon many scientific contributions
and collaborations from around the country and worldwide.
</p>
<p>
The computing capacity behind NDIF comes from <a href="">Delta AI</a>, an NSF
computing infrastructure project developed by NCSA at the University of Illinois
Urbana-Champaign. The community of NDIF users is being devloped and supported
in partnership with the <a href="">Public Interest Technology University Network</a>, a
consortium of 63 universities and colleges.
