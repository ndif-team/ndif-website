<p>
NDIF is under continuous development, and there are several ways to get involved
in the prototype fabric during its construction.
<ul class="px-5"t pus>
  <li><a href="/signup.html">Join our community of early adopters.</a>
    Our online discord server hosts
    students and researchers from many fields who are dissecting the
    behavior and mechanisms of large AI models.  Request early access
    to the prototype NDIF service through this community.
  <li><a href="https://nnsight.net/about">Use our open-source library, nnsight.</a>
    NNsight can be used with NDIF
    and it can also be used with your own local computation power,
    independently of the fabric.  It works with pytorch and can be
    easily installed via pip.
  <li><a href="#jobs">Join our team.</a>
    We are looking for talented and motivated team
    members who are inspired to create a vibrant scientific community to
    crack the mysteries of large-scale AI. Jobs and opportunities are listed
    on this page.
</ul>
