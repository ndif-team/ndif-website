<p>
In the current era of large-scale deep learning, the most interesting AI models are massive black boxes 
that are both costly and difficult to run. Ordinary commercial inference services and APIs let us interact with these models, 
but they do not let us access model internals. We are changing this with NDIF and NNsight.
<ul class="px-5"t pus>
  <li>NDIF is an inference service hosting large open-weight LLMs for use by researchers.
  <li><a href="https://nnsight.net/about" target="_blank" >NNsight</a> is a package for interpreting and manipulating internals of deep learning models.
</ul>
Together, NDIF and NNsight work to enable researchers to run complex experiments on 
huge open AI models easily, with full transparent access. Follow the steps below to get started.

  <h1>Step 2: Sign up for NDIF remote model access</h1>
  </div>
  
  <p>
  In order to remotely access LLMs through NDIF, users must sign up for an NDIF API key.
