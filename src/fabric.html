Developed by Northeastern University in partnership with the
NSF Delta AI high-performance computing cluster at the
NCSA at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, NDIF consists of three major components.
</p>
<p><strong>A nationwide high-performance computing fabric</strong>
hosting the largest open pretrained machine learning models for transparent deep inference. This National Deep Inference Fabric is a unique combination of GPU hardware and deep network AI inference software that provides a remotely-accessible computing resource for scientists to perform detailed and reproducible experiments on large AI systems on the fabric. The fabric is designed for many scientists to efficiently and simultaneously share the same AI computing capacity to make efficient use of resources.

</p>
<p><strong>A novel open-source research software library</strong>
that enables scientists to develop and deploy new research methods on AI models by creating intervention code that inspects, modifies and customizes AI model computations. Our library, called <em>nnsight</em>, enables reproducible scientific experiments to be defined and executed on both the shared large-scale fabric and on a scientistâ€™s own smaller-scale computers.

</p>
<p><strong>A nationwide training program</strong>
to equip researchers and students in every part of the country to utilize NDIF to unlock critical research problems in every field impacted by large-scale AI. Developed together with the Public Interest Technology University Network, a consortium of 63 universities and colleges, the NDIF training program will consist of online modules, course materials, and in-person workshops hosted at multiple sites throughout the United States. It will create a network of experts in a range of fields impacted by AI, provide embedded expertise within their own institutions, and help create a next-generation workforce equipped to understand and harness the mechanisms and capabilities of the systems at the forefront of artificial intelligence.

NDIF is powered by the high-performance computing capacity of Delta AI, a GPU computing cluster
being created at NCSA in 2024.
<br><br>
Taking advantage of next-generation NVIDIA graphics processors,
DeltaAI is part of <a href="https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/research/project-highlights/delta/">Delta</a>,
which is the highest-performance GPU computing resource
in the National Science Foundation portfolio. DeltaAI is
tailored for artificial intelligence workloads such as

  You can use a prototype version of NDIF today!
  The National Deep Inference Fabric is a four-year project,
  with many of the features and much of the capacity of the project to be developed
  during the construction of the project in 2024-2028.  But an early version of NDIF
  is available for you to use today.
  </p>
  <p>
  <a href="./start.html">Visit our Getting Involved page to learn how to
  participate now.</a>
  </p>
  <p>
  Your early participation is an essential part
  of the project. By getting involved early, you can get a jump start
  on using leading-edge AI research methods, and you can also help the NDIF team
  learn how to design the Fabric to be helpful for research like yours.
  We are especially seeking users from outside computer science, so if your
  work is touched by AI in any way, do not hesitate to get involved
  as an early adopter.

<div id="flush-collapseTwo" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlush">
<div class="accordion-body">
  <p>
  Commercial AI inference services such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini
only provide <em>black-box</em> access to large AI models. That is, you can send inputs
to the services and they will give you outputs, but they do not give you access to
observe or alter any of the internal computations.
  </p>
  <p>
  In contrast, NDIF provides full transparency for AI inference, allowing users to
fully examine and modify every step of the internal computation of large AI models.
NDIF provides this access by allowing scientists to specify programs, written using
the <a href="https://nnsight.net/">nnsight library</a>, that can intervene in each
layer and step of AI inference while the AI runs.
  </p>
  <p>
NDIF provides access to all activations and gradients on large-scale open AI models,
and will support interventions, model editing, custom optimizations, and
many other research methods. These essential scientific capabilities are not
available through commercial inference services.

<div class="accordion-body">
  <p>
  Supercomputing, high-performance computing, and cloud computing infrastructure services
are designed to support <em>coarse-grained</em> computing jobs, and they do not natively
support fine-grained sharing of pretrained AI models.  For example, if you wish to
study a large AI model using an HPC system, you need to allocate a large amount
of GPU capacity for your own exclusive use, which is costly, and which can put scarce
resources out of reach for most users.
  </p>
  <p>
  NDIF provides a shared deep inference fabric, which allows many users to access
shared AI models in a fine-grained manner, making economical use of precious hardware
resources. Instead of submitting an entire high-performance computing job, NDIF users
submit specialized deep inference tasks which may run for as briefly as
fraction of a second, exploiting the same preloaded AI models that may be studied
by other users simultanously.
  </p>
  <p>
  NDIF will provide an autoscaling scheduler that provides fair and efficient access
to the most in-demand open models, allowing individual users to customize every
aspect of inference while protecting and isolating different users from each other.

<div class="accordion-body">
  <p>
  The NDIF API is built on pytorch, so using NDIF will be familiar to any
  pytorch user. For example, you can use it to load, run, inspect, and
  modify any pytorch neural network such as open-source models from HuggingFace.
  </p>
  <p>
  However, instead of running models only locally, the API defines
  python contexts in which models can be run with interventions and
  customizations that are defined locally, but which can be executed
  either locally or remotely.
  </p>
  <p>
  This enables a workflow where you can learn about and develop
  experimental methods at a small scale, using your own local hardware
  resources, and then deploy your experiments using the very same
  code at large scale, probing massive neural networks using NDIF.

  and outside the U.S., and it can be used with your own computing hardware.

  The U.S. NSF is providing computing resources to support large-scale scientific
  studies. These resources will be made to educational and research users with
  a U.S. affiliation after a short application. (Eventuallly account creation
  will be automated the CILogin system, and there will be a way to allocate and
