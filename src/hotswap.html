          NDIF is expanding to host many more models remotely using hot-swapping! See our <a href="https://nnsight.net/status/">status page</a> for a preview 
          of some of the models that will be offered through this pilot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before publicly launching model hot-swapping, we are seeking innovative minds to help us test our expanded functionalities on their own AI research.
          This is a unique opportunity for AI researchers to conduct groundbreaking experiments on many different models and their training checkpoints.
          Participants will help us test our new research infrastructure that provides terabytes of GPU resources and the system support 
          necessary to conduct remote experiments on many different dynamically-loaded models.

      <div class="col-md-8 pt-3 text-start">
        <p>We are particularly interested in experiments that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Go beyond conventional benchmarking</li>
          <li>Involve novel interdisciplinary research or model checkpoints</li>
          <li>Exploit the unique access to model internals that NDIF provides</li>
          <li>Would otherwise have limited access to the necessary computational resources</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We strongly encourage applications from diverse fields that bring unique
        perspectives to AI research. We especially welcome applications from
        researchers in U.S. labs aiming to pioneer large-scale AI work at
        their institutions.</p>
